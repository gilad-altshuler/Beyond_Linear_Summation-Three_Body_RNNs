## Run

All the codelines needed can be found in ECG_classification.ipynb.
To be able to run the dataset one need to:

(1) Download manually the datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat.

(2) Uploading to your drive to the directory /content/drive/MyDrive/Deep_Learning/datasets (default in code)

(3) One can choose other directory in drive, but change the link in the code.*

*the last directory must be called "datasets"

This will allow the rest of code to use the heartbeats datasets.

## Results

- Training the model on datasets:
