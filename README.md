Fig 1. Motivation: Three-body interactions. (a) Neuromodulatory axon operate
as a third-body in the synapse. (b) Incorporating glia cells into the network induce
nonlinear summation. (c) Dendritic nonlinearities, where inputs on the same branch
gate each other. (d) Gene expression networks; monomers that can dimerize and serve
as transcription factors for each other, leading to full-rank three-body interaction (TF
in panel = Transcription Factor). (e) Traditional neural network with linear
pre-synaptic summation (left) while biophysics is more complex and input couplings
present (right).
